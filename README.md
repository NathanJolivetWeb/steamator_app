Rails app created in 5 days for the presentation of our final project during my Data Science bootcamp at Le Wagon Lille.

The goal was to create a tool capable of estimating the number of sales of a video game before its launch thanks to machine learning.

The application is coding in rails, with a little javascript (stimulus) and uses an API that we have deployed on GCP for sales prediction.
